The indignity of it kills our imagination. May I propose a Herzog dictum? Those who read own the world. Those who watch television lose it. Sitting at home on your own, in front of the screen, is a very different experience from being in the communal spaces of the world, those centres of collective dreaming. Television creates loneliness. This is why sitcoms have added laughter tracks which try to cheat you out of your solitude. Television is a reflection of the world in which we live, designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It kills spontaneous imagination and destroys our ability to entertain ourselves, painfully erasing our patience and sensitivity to significant detail."])
